Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.. [Tags](https://github.com/otocash/OTOCASH/tags) are created to indicate new official,stable release versions of OTOCASH Core.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions [coding.txt](/doc/coding.txt) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new stable release versions of OTOCASH.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after 15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be labeled 'stale'.


### Building & Deploy

See  [readme-qt](/doc/readme-qt.rst) and [coding.txt](/doc/coding.txt) for instructions on building OTOCASH QT,the intended-for-end-users, nice-graphical-interface, reference implementation of OTOCASH.

See [build-msw.txt](/doc/build-msw.txt) , [build-osx.txt](/doc/build-osx.txt) or [build-unix.txt](/doc/build-unix.txt) for instructions on building otocashd,the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference implementation of OTOCASH.

Testing
-------

Testing ([README](/src/test/README)) and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
